Error Handling Contract
Description
Solidity Version: This contract is written in Solidity version ^0.8.1.
The Error Handling Contract is a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates various error handling techniques using require, assert, and revert statements.
Sets the contract's value to the input _value.
Ensures _value is greater than 0 using require.
Asserts that the new value is different from the current value.
Performs division of _numerator by _denominator and returns the result.
Checks that _denominator is not zero using require.
Reverts with a custom error message if _numerator is not divisible by _denominator.
Requirements
Error Handling
require: Used to validate input conditions that must hold true for the function to proceed.
assert: Used to check for internal errors or conditions that should never occur.
revert: Used to revert state changes and transactions when conditions are not met, providing a custom error message.
